and Mozilla Firefox.</p>
<p>In order to load the webpage, the user must either run the app from a university computer centrally connected to the UCL LAN or alternatively be connected to the UCL VPN.

<h2>How to start the app</h2> <!-- how to start the app: it requires a server connection to work -->
<p>The app does not require any installation and is available at the 
<a href="http://developer.cege.ucl.ac.uk:31295/">WebApp URL web page</a>
</p>
<p>Be sure to be connected to the UCL VPN and start the NodeJSserver and the Phonegap server using a SSH software such as Bitvise, Cyberduck or Fugu.

<p><b>SSH Port</b>: 30095</p>
<p><b>Username</b>: studentuser</p>

<p> - cd /home/studentuser/code (press enter)</p>
<p> - node NodeJSserver.js (press enter - the server is now running and data can be uploaded/downloaded)</p>
<p> - cd /home/studentuser/code/WebApp/ucesegr (press enter)</p>
<p> - sudo su (press enter and enter the admin password)</p>
<p> - phonegap serve (press enter - the Phonegap server is now running)</p>
<p>The user can now access 
<a href="http://developer.cege.ucl.ac.uk:31295/">WebApp web page</a>

<h2>How the app works</h2> 
<p>The app has been designed to be used on a computer and although it can also be accessed from mobile devices, it could be less convenient to operate.</p>
<p>The page displays a map which can be explored to find new possible question locations. The coordinates of a specific point can be accessed by clicking 
on the desired location and copying the lat long values displayed in the pop-up window. The coordinates can then be pasted in the respective fields in
the <i>question form</i>. </p>
<p>The <i>left-side menu</i> shows two options:</p>
<p><b>Add a question</b>: the button redirects the user to the question form to add a new question;</p>
<p><b>Load Points</b>: the button loads the points of interest already uploaded by the server on the database.</p>
<p>The <i>question form</i> contains all the necessary fields to set a question. Once information has been inserted, clicking on the <i>Upload data</i> button will
will record the question on the database. To set up another 
question, either refresh the page or go back to the map, check the newly uploaded point" and open the question form again.</p>
